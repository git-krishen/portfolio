My first try at a portfolio website! 
This website was created from scratch using React + Vite, as an exercise in web development that turned out both fun and informative.
This first iteration of the site is pretty barebones, as it's mostly a proof of concept  that taught me the basics underpinning React, such as the component-based architecture and functional programming style (something new to me, as I've mostly worked with OOP in the past).
Be sure to check back as I add more stuff in the future if you're interested!
